# A Section Heading on its own page

## A heading that starts on a new page

This document shows a few basics on making slides with R markdown.

To produce the slides, Knit to HMTL (ioslides).

(You can also knit to PDF if you have LaTeX installed on your computer.)


---

Three dashes starts a new page when it is not started by a new header.

---

### This is a heading that doesn't start a new page

You can make text **bold** or in *italics*.

To make bullet points, start the points after a blank line:
 
- point one
- another point


---

Include some R output

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_point()
```

---

Include the output without showing the code and R messages (which is what you want for your poster presentation).  This R code chunk also changes the size of the plot.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed, y=dist)) + geom_point()
```

This plot shows that there is a positive relationship between distance and speed.

# Headings you should include in your project

## Introduction

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading all dataframes
source('scripts/load_data.R')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Drawing map
world <- map_data("world") 

iu <- internetusers_data %>% rename(region = Country) 

iu$region[4] <- "USA" # to match world map data

iu <- semi_join(iu, world, by = "region") #only keep countries according to world map data

# code below is modified from 
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29614972/ggplot-us-state-map-colors-are-fine-polygons-jagged-r
gg <- ggplot()

gg <- gg + geom_map(
  data = world,
  map = world,
  aes(x = long, y = lat, map_id = region),
  fill = "#ffffff",
  color = "#ffffff",
  size = 0.20
)

gg <- gg + geom_map(
  data = iu,
  map = world,
  aes(fill = `INTERNET USERS`, map_id = region),
  color = "#ffffff",
  size = 0.15
)

gg <- gg + scale_fill_continuous(low = 'thistle2', high = 'darkblue',
                                 guide = 'colorbar')

Include here a few sentences to introduce the problem and provide context. You might want to briefly summarize the data in words (what is the data and what is it used for). You can present the questions you are investigating here. 

## Correlation Between Total Population and Internet Users
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('scripts/population.R')

top_internetusers_plot
```

## World Region
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('scripts/world_region.R')

region_total_internetuser_graph

```

## World Region
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
region_density_internetuser_graph
```

## Health
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('scripts/health.R')

lifeexpect_internet_graph

```

## Health
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

lifeexpect_internet_density_graph
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
lifeexpect_internet_density_graph_line
summary(lifeexpect_internet_model)$coefficients
summary(lifeexpect_internet_model)$r.squared
>>>>>>> added comments, added linear regression for health
```


## Correlation Between GDP and Internet Users
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('scripts/gdp.R')

internetusers_gdp_joint_graph
```

This plot shows the positive relationship between GDP and Internet users in developing and developed countries.

## Correlation Between Education and Internet Users
```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

## Correlation Between Democracy and Internet Users
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('scripts/democracy.R')

democracy_tree

```

## Prediction of Density of Internet Users with Family Income Distributions
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('scripts/IncomeDistribution.R')

income_regression

```

## Linear Model
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mod_summary$coefficients
```


## Objectives (optional)

You can list the questions of interest in complete English sentences here to highlight them. 

```{r}

```

## Data Summary (optional)

Here you can explain how you cleaned the data and created variables suitable for answering your questions. 
You can also include graphical displays that either motivated or address the questions.

```{r}
  ## We are concerened with the relationship between the internet users and various factors such as gdp, education, and democracy. We joined the population table with the factors tables by country. This helps us compare the density of internet users in a country with each of the factors. 
```


## Statistical Methods

Describe here what you have done to the data without presenting any results (output). If you want to indicate variables by symbols or variable names, define them here. 

```{r}
  ##
```


## Results

Present the main results here, in order of importance, related to the questions asked. You might use tables or graphs, or other ways to summarize your results.

```{r}
  ##
```


## Conclusion
  For GDP:
Developed countries (Countries have high GDP, e.g. Japan, Germany) have a larger number of internet users, and developing countries (Countries have low GDP, e.g. Ethiopia, Kenya) have a less number of internet users.

Developing countries who are making effort to be a developed country (Countries have medium GDP, e.g. Brazil, Mexico ) have the large variation of internet users domestically. 
Give your main conclusions here. Follow the order of questions you presented. 


```{r}
